Contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulations *Accurately quantifying photon recycling in perovskite films reveals true internal luminescence quantum efficiency* submitted to Nature Communications.

It generates 'externally-observed' photoluminescence spectra, with the internal PL and absorption coefficient spectra as input.

The simulation can be run and the parameters be changed through the file 'run_Monte-Carlo'.
