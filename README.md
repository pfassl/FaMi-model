# monte-carlo_ncomms
Contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulations for the paper *Accurate quantification of photon recycling in perovskite films reveals true internal luminescence quantum efficiency* submitted to Nature Communications.

It generates 'externally-observed' photoluminescence spectra, with the internal PL and absorption coefficient spectra (obtained from confocal PL microsopy) as input.

The simulation can be run and the parameters be changed via the file 'run_MonteCarlo.m'.
The code itself is available in 'MonteCarlo_code.m'.
