# Monte Carlo simmulations
This repisitory contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulations for the paper *Accurate quantification of photon recycling in perovskite films reveals true internal luminescence quantum efficiency* submitted to Nature Communications.

It generates 'externally-observed' photoluminescence spectra with the internal PL and absorption coefficient spectra (obtained from confocal PL microsopy) as input. More information can be found in the Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 19 of the submitted paper.

The file 'MonteCarlo_code.m' contains the code itself.

The file 'Example-data.mat' contains the internal PL and absorption coefficient spectra used as input for the simulations.

The file 'run_MonteCarlo.m' allows changing the input parameters, runs the simulation, plots the data and saves the results as txt-file.
