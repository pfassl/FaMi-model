# monte-carlo_ncomms
Contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulations for the paper *Accurate quantification of photon recycling in perovskite films reveals true internal luminescence quantum efficiency* submitted to Nature Communications.

It generates 'externally-observed' photoluminescence spectra, with the internal PL and absorption coefficient spectra (obtained from confocal PL microsopy) as input (included in 'Example-data.mat'). More information can be found in the Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 19.

The simulation can be run and the parameters be changed via the file 'run_MonteCarlo.m'.
The code itself is available in 'MonteCarlo_code.m'.
